            <li><h6>Content Marketing:</h6> Content marketing involves creating and distributing valuable and relevant content to attract and engage a target audience.

            <li><h6>Search Engine Optimization (SEO):</h6>SEO is the practice of optimizing your online content and website to improve its visibility in search engine results (e.g., Google).

            <li><h6>Social Media Marketing:</h6> Social media marketing involves using platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and others to connect with your audience, promote your brand, and drive engagement. This can include organic (unpaid) posting and paid advertising.</li>

            <li><h6>Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Advertising:</h6> PPC advertising, often associated with platforms like Google Ads and Bing Ads, allows you to display ads to potential customers based on keywords and other targeting criteria. You pay only when a user clicks on your ad.</li>

            <li><h6>Analytics and Data Analysis:</h6>Analyzing data to track the effectiveness of your digital marketing efforts is essential. This includes measuring website traffic, conversion rates, social media engagement, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).</li>
            <li><h6>Marketing Automation:</h6>Marketing automation tools help streamline and automate marketing tasks, such as email campaigns, lead nurturing, and personalized customer interactions.</li>
            <li><h6>E-commerce Marketing:</h6> If you have an online store, e-commerce marketing focuses on strategies to attract and convert online shoppers. This includes cart abandonment recovery, product recommendations, and more.</li>
